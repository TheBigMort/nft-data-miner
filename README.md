# nft-data-miner

Mines data for NFTs.

Enter an NFT project's contract address and this program
will create a .csv file with all of the NFTs in the
collection along with their traits and recent sale data.
 UPDATE: OpenSea requires an API key so this program will no longer work. 
 I am working on a JS library that will do what this program did and more without a key.
